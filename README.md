# Algorithm_Analysis_Project
This project is part of the seng313 course, focusing on implementing and analyzing various algorithms to solve different computational problems. The project includes solutions for sorting datasets, finding optimal routes, and detecting plagiarism between text documents.  

Divide and Conquer Sorting:Implements efficient sorting algorithms using the divide and conquer approach to handle large datasets.Example algorithms include Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

Greedy Algorithm:Used for solving optimization problems by making the locally optimal choice at each step, aiming to find a global optimum.Applied in problems involving minimal costs or shortest paths.

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) Algorithm:Used for comparing two text documents and identifying the longest matching sequences.Applied in the plagiarism detection tool to detect similarities between text files.

Graph Algorithms – Dijkstra’s Shortest Path:Implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.Suitable for network routing problems or pathfinding in real-world scenarios.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all nodes of a graph layer by layer, useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs and exploring graph structures. The algorithm starts at a selected node and visits all its neighbors before moving to the next level. It is implemented using a queue-based approach to ensure each node is processed in the correct order.
